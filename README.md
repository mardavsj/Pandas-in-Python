Pandas is a powerful and versatile library that simplifies tasks of data manipulation in Python. It is built on the top of the NumPy library which means that a lot of structures of NumPy are used or replicated in Pandas. It is well-suited for working with tabular data, such as spreadsheets or SQL tables.

Pandas is a powerful and open-source library Python library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and functions for efficient operations.

## Pre-requisites :
* Python
* Pip or Conda (depending on user)
## Installation :

Install NumPy with pip :

```bash
  pip install pandas
```

Install NumPy with conda :

```bash
  conda create -c conda-forge -n name_of_my_env python pandas

  # This will create a minimal environment with only Python and pandas installed. To put your self inside this environment run :
  source activate name_of_my_env
  # On Windows :
  activate name_of_my_env
```


    
## Why use Pandas ? 

* Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.

* Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.

* Relevant data is very important in data science.
